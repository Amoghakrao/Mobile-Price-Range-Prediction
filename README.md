Mobile Price Range Prediction In the competitive mobile phone market companies want to understand sales data of mobile phones and factors which drive the prices. The objective is to find out some relation between features of a mobile phone(eg:- RAM, Internal Memory, etc) and its selling price. In this problem, we do not have to predict the actual price but a price range indicating how high the price is.

The dataset is clean (no null values or duplicate records) and well-maintained. Based on EDA, target classes are generally balanced and don’t differ significantly. The majority of categorical features have a similar distribution (except for ‘three_g’ where very few records were found of mobile phones without 3G access). With the exception of a few ‘corrected’ numerical features, most numerical features follow a homogeneous distribution. The number of categorical features doesn’t change much with price ranges. However, we did observe a slight increase for each feature for the very high cost category. RAM is the most correlated feature and is the most important factor in determining price ranges. The battery power and the pixel resolution have a slight correlation to the target variable. These four features have a strong influence on price ranges. In addition to these features, there is no other feature with a good correlation to target variable.


Machine learning algorithms were applied to the split and standardized dataset, and their performance was assessed using various evaluation metrics. The classification models employed were decision trees, logistic regression, support vector machines, and K-nearest neighbors (KNN). The results indicated that all four models performed reasonably well in predicting price ranges. Notably, KNN and support vector machines exhibited the highest accuracy, achieving a 95% accuracy rate.It was observed that the key determinants of price ranges were RAM, battery power, pixel height, and pixel width. Higher values for these factors were associated with a broader price range. It's worth noting that as technology advances, these numerical values may change over time, emphasizing the need for periodic model reevaluation.
